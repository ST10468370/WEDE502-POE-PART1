<p>Tusk acknowledges issues we face when it comes to sustainability, global warming and related environmental crises, as well as the problems that consumers experience when assembling ordered furniture pieces, such as, the need of powered machinery and tools that are not provided to consumers by the company. Through like-minded and like-hearted efforts, Tusk aim is to address these issues by providing bespoke, hand- crafted, multi-functional, sustainable furniture that allows customers to easily assemble their piece, with the use of their hands and nothing else, as well as aiding and supporting a greater cause. </p>
